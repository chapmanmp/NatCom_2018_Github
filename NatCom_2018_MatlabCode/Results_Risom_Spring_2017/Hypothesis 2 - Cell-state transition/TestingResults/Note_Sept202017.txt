    to generate the figures.
    
Figure key
    -Red dotted lines : predictions using models identified on 15-well data set under cell-state transition hypothesis
    -Black solid lines : test data (4-well data set, collected on a different day, evenly distributed death)
    -Each point : mean at the center, error bar is standard deviation, computed from 4 samples
