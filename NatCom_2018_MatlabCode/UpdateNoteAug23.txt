Aug. 23, 2017

Tyler provided updated standard deviations for the observed fold change.

I revised "RealFoldChangeObservations" with these values.

I uploaded the .mat files for each hypothesis (Results_Risom_Spring_2017), and regenerated the fold change plots with the updated empirical data.

The figures in Results_Risom_Spring_2017 with the date "Aug. 23".

The RisomCode.zip file does not contain these updates.

Updated files were uploaded to Dropbox.
